# LiveMeet
LiveMeet is a real-time video conferencing platform built using WebRTC, Socket.io, and Node.js.
The platform enables peer-to-peer audio/video communication, dynamic room creation, and real-time signaling, while ensuring reliable connectivity using STUN servers for NAT traversal.

This project demonstrates expertise in real-time communication, networking concepts, WebRTC internals, and scalable event-driven backend systems.
